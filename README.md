## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/Perum-PPD/Risk-Register.git
   
2. Switch to the repo folder
   sh
   cd root folder (Risk-Register)

3. Migrate DB and Seeder
   sh
   php spark migrate

4. Run local server
